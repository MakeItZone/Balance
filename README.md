Ludum Dare Game Jam #50 Entry

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

We're taking advantage of the new casual/extra category and will keep working on this to April 21st!

We’re a Makerspace and Education centre in Courtenay, Vancouver Island, and we’re super keen to be participating in LD! LD50 is super lucky timing for us- it’s at the end of the second week of our local Spring school break. We’re arranging an open house on the afternoons of the week before and have invited a few people to join us. We’re going to try and learn enough unity over the week to be able to complete something for the Jam, and really appreciate the new “casual” option- I think we’ll need some extra time! I’m suggesting courses on GameDev.tv, YouTube and the (free) Wireframe book on making a FPS with unity to study from- suggestions for resources much appreciated!

I’m hoping the everyone who participates has a good time and forms a core group to start regular participation in future LD events.
